Hi,
I am a postdoctoral researcher at University of Florida where I work with Dr. Swarup Bhunia. I am affliated with the Warren B Nelms Institute at the Electrical Engineering Department. I did my Ph.D at IIT Madras, where I was advised by Dr. V. Kamakoti. I am affiliated with RISE Lab in the Computer Science Department.

I like to work on problems related to energy efficient computing, harware security and computer architecture. I am open for collaborations in this area. Please feel free to reach out and contact me in this regard. 
I like teaching and I hope to join academia eventually. Apart from my research activities, I like reading books, building Legos, and photography.
