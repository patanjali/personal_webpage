abstract="Illegal memory accesses are a serious security vulnerability that have been exploited on numerous occasions. In this letter, we present Gandalf, a compiler assisted hardware extension for the OpenRISC processor that thwarts all forms of memory-based attacks. We associate lightweight capabilities to all program variables, which are checked at run time by the hardware. Gandalf is transparent to the user and does not require significant OS modifications. Moreover, it achieves locality and incurs minimal overheads in the hardware. We demonstrate these features with a customized Linux kernel executing SPEC2006 benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate a complete solution for hardware-based memory protection schemes for embedded platforms."
